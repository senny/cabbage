## Overview

e-max helps you to manage your emacs configuration and allows you to stay in sync with other fellow emacs users. It is designed to be a community-driven framework to build your emacs configuration. The ultimate goal of e-max is to provide a hassle-free, fast and robust emacs setup.

## Requirements

We want to get e-max working under as many different circumstances as possible. We are aiming to make the configuration as platform-/emacs-version independent as possible. So all you need to use e-max is Emacs.
